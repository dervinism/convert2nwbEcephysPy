# convert2nwbPy
Python functions to convert extracellular electrophysiology recordings and associated behavioural data to Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) file format. These functions work with both Neuropixels and Neuronexus data.

PyNWB installation instructions are available [here](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_users.html). Other dependencies include h5py, numpy, scipy, pathlib, os, re, datetime, dateutil which often come preinstalled.

To get the code with the accompanying example data and test it, download [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) repositories [convert2nwbPyNnx](https://gin.g-node.org/dervinism/convert2nwbPyNnx) and [convert2nwbPyNpx](https://gin.g-node.org/dervinism/convert2nwbPyNpx) for Neuronexus and Neuropixels data, respectively. Follow individual repository instructions on how to get and run the files.
